The  `tag` command in MarinaBox CLI is used to add or update a tag for a session. Tags help with session identification and categorization and can be applied to both running and closed sessions.

---

## Command Syntax

```bash
mb local tag <SESSION_ID> <TAG>
```

---

## Description

This command allows you to:
- Assign a new tag to a session for better organization.
- Update the tag of an existing session (running or closed).

Tags are especially useful for grouping sessions based on use cases or workflows.

---

## Example Usage

### Add a Tag to a Running Session:
```bash
mb local tag abc123xyz Development
```

### Update the Tag for a Closed Session:
```bash
mb local tag xyz789abc ArchivedSession
```

---

## Example Output

For a successful tagging operation:
```bash
Tag updated successfully
```

If the `session_id` is invalid or the session does not exist:
```bash
Session not found
```

---

## Notes

- Use the `session_id` from the `list` or `list-closed` command to ensure you're tagging the correct session.
- Tags are optional but can significantly improve session tracking and organization.
- This command works for both active and closed sessions.
