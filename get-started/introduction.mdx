### 1. Secure AI Agent Task Execution
You may want AI agents to have access to a computer to perform tasks (e.g., Claude Computer Use). Allowing them direct access to your computer can be risky since important files might be modified or sensitive data accessed. MarinaBox provides an isolated sandbox to perform these tasks securely.

---

### 2. Web Navigation and Browser Automation
Allowing AI agents to navigate the web and automatically perform tasks is a growing use case. For example:
- Booking airline tickets
- Filling out web forms

MarinaBox provides a sandboxed Chromium browser tailored for such tasks. Additionally, MarinaBox’s browser sandbox works seamlessly with tools such as Playwright and Selenium, making it ideal for browser automation workflows.

### 3. Enhanced User Experience with Human-in-the-Loop
Creating effective AI-based tools requires seamless human interaction(Human in the Loop) at critical moments. MarinaBox's live session view enables this by allowing users to directly interact with and take control of the sandbox environment whenever needed.
- Embed a live session view of your sandbox.
- Enable users to take control of the application at any moment.
