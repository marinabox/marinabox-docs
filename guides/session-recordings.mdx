# Session Recordings

MarinaBox automatically records all sessions, allowing you to review browser interactions after a session has ended. These recordings are stored locally and can be accessed using standard media players.

## Finding Recording Files

To locate the recording for a specific session, first list your closed sessions:

```bash
mb local list-closed
```

This will return an array of closed sessions with their details, including the video path:

```json
{
  "session_id": "f730cc137deb",
  "video_path": "/Users/username/.marinabox/videos/f730cc137deb.mp4",
  "status": "stopped",
  // ... other fields
}
```

## Video File Location

By default, recordings are stored in:
- macOS/Linux: `~/.marinabox/videos/`
- Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.marinabox\videos\`

Each recording is named using the session ID (e.g., `f730cc137deb.mp4`).
