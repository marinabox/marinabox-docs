## Stop Session

Stops a running session and moves it to the closed sessions list.

### Python SDK

```python
from marinabox import MarinaboxSDK

sdk = MarinaboxSDK()
success = sdk.stop_session("abc123xyz")

if success:
    print("Session stopped successfully")
else:
    print("Failed to stop session")
```

### Behavior

When stopping a session, the SDK performs the following actions:
1. Gracefully stops the ffmpeg recording process
2. Saves the session recording video file
3. Stops and removes the Docker container
4. Updates session status and calculates final runtime
5. Moves session to closed sessions list

### Error Handling

```python
try:
    success = sdk.stop_session("abc123xyz")
    if not success:
        print("Failed to stop session")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error stopping session: {e}")
```
