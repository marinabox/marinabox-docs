The `stop` command in MarinaBox CLI is used to stop a running session using its session ID. This ensures that resources are released and the session is gracefully terminated.

---

## Command Syntax

```bash
mb local stop <SESSION_ID>
```

---

## Description

This command stops a specific active session identified by its `session_id`. It:
1. Gracefully shuts down processes running within the sandbox.
2. Releases allocated resources like memory and ports.
3. Moves the session to the closed sessions list for historical tracking.

---

## Example Usage

### Stop a Specific Session:
```bash
mb local stop abc123xyz
```

#### Example Output:
```bash
Session stopped successfully
```

If the session ID is invalid or the session is already stopped, an error message is displayed:
```bash
Failed to stop session
```

---

## Notes

- Use the `session_id` from the `list` command to ensure you're targeting the correct active session.
- This command does not affect sessions that are already closed. Use the `list-closed` command to view stopped sessions.
