# Basic Connection Example

After creating a browser session with MarinaBox, you can connect to it using Playwright. This guide shows you how to write a simple script to connect and interact with the browser session.

## Getting Session Details

First, list your active sessions to get the WebSocket URL:

```bash
mb local list
```

You'll see output like this:

```json
{
  "session_id": "a963accd3608",
  "websocket_url": "ws://127.0.0.1:4002/devtools/browser/91d7ff24-7c83-4203-94d5-b11d20029d26",
  "status": "running"
  // ... other fields
}
```

## Python Script

Here's a complete example showing how to connect to the session:

```python
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

def main():
    # WebSocket URL from 'mb local list' command
    cdp_ws_url = "ws://127.0.0.1:4002/devtools/browser/91d7ff24-7c83-4203-94d5-b11d20029d26"

    with sync_playwright() as p:
        # Connect to the existing browser session
        browser = p.chromium.connect_over_cdp(cdp_ws_url)
        
        # Get or create browser context
        contexts = browser.contexts
        context = contexts[0] if contexts else browser.new_context()

        # Create a new page
        page = context.new_page()

        # Navigate to a website
        page.goto("https://google.com")
        print(f"Page title: {page.title()}")

        # Clean up
        context.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

That's it! This script:
1. Connects to your running browser session
2. Opens a new page
3. Navigates to a website
4. Closes the connection

You can use this as a starting point for more complex browser automation tasks.
